# Release Planning

This document outlines Dragonfly process for planning and scheduling releases, so you
can familiarize yourself with the flow of work from opening an issue to seeing
it published in a release.

We aim to ship updates to production approximately every 6 months, to ensure a continuous flow of improvements to our users. 

## Release version

All release artifacts must follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Each release milestone increments the minor version. In exceptional cases, the major version can be increased too.

We organize releases in two ways - marketing and milestones:

 - Marketing releases are what we use to represent stable version.
      - **for example: v2.1, v2.2, etc.**
 - Milestones are used to track issues and pull requests associated with an upcoming release, and can be [followed on GitHub](https://github.com/Dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/milestones)
      - **for example: v2.1.x, v2.1.0-alpha.x, v2.1.0-beta.x, etc.**

Hotfixes should also be applied directly into each of the impacted release branches. Then, the fix can be merged back into master (or main) branch or cherry-picked.

## Release milestone

The Dragonfly project is under continuous development addressing issues for both bugs on existing features and new features. Each release goes through three phases in a 26 week (6 months) period.
-	Feature definition (~ 4 weeks)
-	Feature implementation (~ 18 weeks)
-	Stabilization and release (~ 4 weeks)

Most significant features take at least 2 releases to become included in a release, and through the preview feature process often more. Therefore as a release comes to a close, it is not unusual to move a complex feature to the next milestone to give it time to complete the requirements of the feature lifecycle.

## Release note

[Dragonfly Maintainers](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) from different companies take turns to prepare key information such as release notes.

## Release team

The release team has the responsibility of enforcing processes to ensure the release is successfully delivered. The release team consists of the following roles:

-	**Release manager.**  This role oversees enforcing the processes for a release and ensuring communication to all contributors and community on the ongoing status of the release. For each release, a release manager is chosen from the Dragonfly maintainers.
